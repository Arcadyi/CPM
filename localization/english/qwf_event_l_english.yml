 geneva_conventions.1.t:0 "The Creation of the League of Nations"
 geneva_conventions.1.d:0 "As more and more countries acceded to the Geneva Conventions, the Powers decided to create a joint international organisation with the main purpose of preserving peace, reducing armaments and imposing mandates, and settling international disputes peacefully. With [SCOPE.sCountry('country_ranking_1').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('country_ranking_2').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('country_ranking_3').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('country_ranking_4').GetName] were elected as permanent members and the League of Nations was officially proclaimed."
 qwf_gw.0002.t:0 "Challengers of Order"
 qwf_gw.0002.d:0 "With the current international situation on the brink, any [concept_great_power] initiation of a war footing would lead to an uproar. And with [SCOPE.sC('great_power_troublemakers').GetName] now filling that role, our country has long been rendered the [concept_order_challenger] of the current world order, and this is certainly a good opportunity to reshuffle the current order."
 qwf_gw.0002.f:0 "A great war seems inevitable"
 qwf_gw.0001.a:0 "For the glory! Victory belongs to #V [GetGlobalVariable('qwf_order_challenger').GetCountry.GetName]#!!"
 qwf_gw.0001.b:0 "It's too risky..."
 qwf_gw.1001.t:0 "The Great War is over"
 qwf_gw.1001.d:0 "With the end of the Great War, all the countries that were on the opposing side of the war declared their independence at the behest of the victorious [concept_great_power]. At the same time, all the victorious nations could claim [concept_great_war_reparations] from the defeated nations to compensate the victorious nations for their losses in the Great War."
 qwf_gw.1001.f:0 "We won, but at the cost of the blood of a generation."
 qwf_gw.1001.a:0 "It looks like a new order has been established."
 qwf_gw.1002.t:0 "The Great War is over"
 qwf_gw.1002.d:0 "With the signing of the Peace Treaty of the Great War, we were forced to surrender to the victorious powers, and at the behest of the [concept_great_power] that defeated us in the Great War, all of our dependent countries have declared their independence. At the same time all the victorious powers were able to claim [concept_great_war_reparations] from us and the other defeated powers to compensate the victorious powers for their losses in the Great War."
 qwf_gw.1002.f:0 "We have lost a generation and the pride and honour we had before the war."
 qwf_gw.1002.a:0 "We had to give in."
 qwf_gw.1002.b:0 "It's just a truce!"
 qwf_gw.1003.t:0 "The Great War is over"
 qwf_gw.1003.d:0 "The Great War, with its heavy casualties, has finally ended, with [SCOPE.sC('great_power_leader_won').GetName] leading the peace talks and [SCOPE.sC('great_power_leader_lose').GetName] being accused of starting the war. All the vassal states of the defeated nation have declared their independence, and the victorious nation is planning to claim [concept_great_war_reparations] against the defeated side as punishment for starting the war."
 qwf_gw.1003.f:0 "The world order has been reshuffled."
 qwf_gw.1003.a:0 "Let's hope the war to end all wars"
 qwf_gw.1004.t:0 "Recasting order: a fiasco"
 qwf_gw.1004.d:0 "With the end of the war, [SCOPE.sC('great_power_leader_won').GetName] was able to gain the approval of many [concept_great_power] and became a participant in the new order. Our country was thus disgraced and despised by the other [concept_great_power]."
 qwf_gw.1004.f:0 "We are not considered to be a great power that builds order anymore."
 qwf_gw.1004.a:0 "One day [SCOPE.sC('great_power_leader_lose').GetName]'ll get what she deserves!"
 qwf_gw.1005.t:0 "Recasting order: Victory"
 qwf_gw.1005.d:0 "As the war came to an end, my country gained the recognition of many [concept_great_power] as a participant in the new order, as it had hoped. [SCOPE.sC('great_power_leader_lose').GetName] was thus disgraced and despised by the other [concept_great_power]."
 qwf_gw.1005.f:0 "We are now considered to be the power that built the order."
 qwf_gw.1005.a:0 "This is what [SCOPE.sC('great_power_leader_won').GetName] should get."
 qwf_gw.1006.t:0 "Recasting order: maintaining the status quo"
 qwf_gw.1006.d:0 "The international community had thought that this recasting of the order would lead to a reversal or consolidation of the existing order, but now it seems to have been very wrong. The stalemate between [concept_great_power] and [concept_great_power] has ended in a mutual compromise to continue with the current international order."
 qwf_gw.1006.f:0 "This tigerish [concept_diplomatic_play] didn't change anything."
 qwf_gw.1006.a:0 "This is the peace of our time."
