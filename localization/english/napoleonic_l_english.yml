Legitimists on the right demand the restoration of the Bourbons to the throne. The leftist republicans on the left are still a powerful force. The more time passes, Louis-Philippe becomes more and more rigid and dogmatic, and his entourage loses all popularity. The situation gradually escalates, which could lead to unintended consequences."

 orleanist_flavor.1.d:0 "The Orleans monarchy, which marked the transition of power from the house of Bourbon to its younger branch, the House of Orleans, was a triumph of popular sovereignty over the principle of the divine right of the king, and also established a liberal order, a triumph for the bourgeoisie and the final defeat of the landed aristocracy. Despite all the opposition, the rule of the House of Orleans seems increasingly immutable even to the most radical opponents of the regime."
 orleanist_flavor.1.f:0 "«In the midst of the agitation that enemy or blind passions are fomenting, one conviction animates and sustains me, and that is that we possess in the constitutional monarchy, in the union of the great powers of the State, the most assured means of overcoming all these obstacles, and of satisfying all the moral and material interests of our beloved fatherland. Let us firmly maintain, according to the Charter, the social order and all its conditions. Let us faithfully guarantee, according to the Charter, the public liberties and all their developments. We will hand over intact to the generations that will come after us the deposit that has been entrusted to us, and they will bless us for having founded and defended the edifice under the shelter of which they will live happy and free.» - Louis-Philippe d'Orléans"

The next day barricades were erected in several places, but all attempts at rebellion were quickly crushed. Soon a popular vote of seven and a half million votes to 650,000 approved the head of state's proposals, and Louis Napoleon promulgated a new constitution, modeled on the «constitutions of the empire»."

I say, the empire means peace. France longs for peace, and if France is satisfied the world is tranquil. War is not made with pleasure, it is made by necessity, and in these changing times where everywhere, next to so many elements of prosperity spring so many causes of death, we may say truthfully “Woe to whoever might give the signal for a collision in Europe, of which the consequences would be beyond our imaginations!”» - Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte"
