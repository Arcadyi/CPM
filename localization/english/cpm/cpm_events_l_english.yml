 orleanist_flavor.1.t:0 "The End of the Political Crisis"
 orleanist_flavor.1.d:0 "The Orleans monarchy, which marked the transition of power from the house of Bourbon to its younger branch, the House of Orleans, was a triumph of popular sovereignty over the principle of the divine right of the king, and also established a liberal order, a triumph for the bourgeoisie and the final defeat of the landed aristocracy. Despite all the opposition, the rule of the House of Orleans seems increasingly immutable even to the most radical opponents of the regime."
 orleanist_flavor.1.f:0 "«In the midst of the agitation that enemy or blind passions are fomenting, one conviction animates and sustains me, and that is that we possess in the constitutional monarchy, in the union of the great powers of the State, the most assured means of overcoming all these obstacles, and of satisfying all the moral and material interests of our beloved fatherland. Let us firmly maintain, according to the Charter, the social order and all its conditions. Let us faithfully guarantee, according to the Charter, the public liberties and all their developments. We will hand over intact to the generations that will come after us the deposit that has been entrusted to us, and they will bless us for having founded and defended the edifice under the shelter of which they will live happy and free.» - Louis-Philippe d'Orléans"

 orleanist_flavor.2.t:0 "Proclamation of the Second Republic"
 orleanist_flavor.2.d:0 "Discontent with the political situation reached its peak as crowds poured into the streets of Paris and erected barricades. In what many saw as an accident, a French guardsman opened fire with his musket on the townspeople and carried out a massacre. Rioting like fire engulfed the entire city, with crowds chanting "Long live the reforms!" and "Down with the king!" Despite assurances that the situation was under control, the king fled the country... Now the government is faced with the task of creating a new system, beginning with the organization of the election of a new head of state."
 orleanist_flavor.2.f:0 "«Citizens, for me, the red flag, I will never adopt it, and I am going to tell you why I'm against it with all the strength of my patriotism. It's that the tricolor has toured the world with the Republic and the Empire, with your freedoms and your glories, and the red flag has only toured the Champ-de-Mars, dragged in the blood of the people.» - Alphonse de Lamartine"

 orleanist_flavor.3.d:0 "In order to propagate reforms while circumventing strict prohibitions on unions and assemblies, first in Paris and later in large provincial cities, wealthy members of the reform movement began to organize public banquets. In their speeches they loudly spoke of reform projects and sometimes sharply criticized the government. The main goal of this movement was the liberalization of the electoral laws."
 orleanist_flavor.3.f:0 "«Program of the banquet. \nThe gates of the site where the banquet is organized will open at three o'clock. \nThe banquet will be presided over by monsieur Bouchard, doctor, first deputy of the city. \nAt four o'clock, monsieur de Lamartine will take his place. \nFrom three to four, and from four to the time of the president's toast, monsieurs artists and amateurs will perform pieces of harmony. \nNo toasts are to be given except those of the president and of monsieur de Lamartine. \nNo songs or shouts will be allowed. \nComplaints and requests will be addressed to the commissioners in charge of the banquet police. \nThe greatest order must reign, in order to let this demonstration have its fruitful influence»."

The provisional government candidate, [SCOPE.sCharacter('industrialists_leader').GetFullName], who led the efforts to suppress the riots in Paris, is disliked by the masses, which does not add to his popularity. At the same time, the interior minister in the provisional government and Montagnard leader [SCOPE.sCharacter('union_leader').GetFullName] received the support of the radical left, despite his participation in the suppression of the Paris riots."

 french_flavor.2.d:0 "Overnight, the most influential figures of the opposition political parties were arrested, military troops occupied strategic squares and streets in Paris, and proclamations were posted on house corners announcing the dissolution of Parliament and the restoration of universal suffrage, inviting the people to allow the head of state to really govern the country. The next day barricades were erected in several places, but all attempts at rebellion were quickly crushed. Soon a popular vote of seven and a half million votes to 650,000 approved the head of state's proposals, and Louis Napoleon promulgated a new constitution, modeled on the «constitutions of the empire»."
 french_flavor.2.f:0 "«If, on the contrary, you still have confidence in me, give me the means of accomplishing the great mission which I hold from you. This mission consists in closing the era of revolutions, in satisfying the legitimate wants of the people, and in protecting them against subversive passions. It consists, especially, in creating institutions which can survive men, and which will be foundations upon which one can build something durable.» - Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte"

 french_flavor.4.t:0 "Proclamation of the Second Empire"
 french_flavor.4.d:0 "For the first time the fate of France was decided not in the capital but in the provinces. The plebiscite for the restoration of the empire, organized after the establishment of the regime of personal power, brought Louis-Napoleon the expected success. Seventy-six percent of voters voted for the empire, and soon Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was proclaimed «emperor of the French» under the name Napoleon III."
 french_flavor.4.f:0 "«There is, nevertheless, one apprehension, and that I shall set at rest. A spirit of distrust leads certain persons to say that the empire means war. I say, the empire means peace. France longs for peace, and if France is satisfied the world is tranquil. War is not made with pleasure, it is made by necessity, and in these changing times where everywhere, next to so many elements of prosperity spring so many causes of death, we may say truthfully “Woe to whoever might give the signal for a collision in Europe, of which the consequences would be beyond our imaginations!”» - Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte"

Moreover, a general loyal to the government managed to send a telegram to the War Ministry warning of a possible attempted mutiny, after which Louis-Napoleon was arrested along with his entourage."

 french_flavor.7.d:0 "The emperor had finally lost support among the common people, the intelligentsia, and the bourgeoisie. All hopes for a bright future and the ascension of France to greatness, which had arisen at the time of the proclamation of the Second Empire, have dissipated. The Emperor had by his actions nurtured many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they chose the moment to strike. They assembled at the Palais des Bourbons, where they announced the overthrow of the Emperor and the proclamation of the Third French Republic. The Bonapartist forces were unable to oppose them, and were forced with great reluctance to acknowledge what had happened."
 french_flavor.7.f:0 "«Frenchmen! The people have forestalled the Chamber that was hesitating. To save the country in danger, they claimed for the Republic: it is announced, and this revolution is led to the public law’s and public safety’s names.

 conquest_of_algeria.1.d:0 "From the very beginning of the conquest, armed resistance against our army began to arise spontaneously in many regions of Algeria. The local nobility could not nominate a leader from among themselves (the appanage beys challenged each other for seniority and leadership) until a real leader was found. It was Emir Abdelkader, a descendant of the Arab rulers of Algeria, who had returned from political exile in Egypt after the fall of the Turks. The situation in the regions of Algeria under his control must be closely monitored."

This plan should seriously weaken the Emir of Mascar and Bey Constantine, and stabilize and consolidate the French position in Algeria."

 conquest_of_algeria.3.d:0 "Prior to the outbreak of active hostilities, the struggle was in Abdelkader's favor. However, French troops increased their mobility and pursued a scorched earth policy, starving the Algerian population and causing a sharp drop in the morale of the guerrilla resistance. Abdelkader was forced to surrender in exchange for a promise that he would be allowed to seek exile in Alexandria or Acre. His request was granted, and two days later he formally surrendered to the French governor-general, to whom Abdelkader symbolically handed over his warhorse."
