 orleanist_flavor.1.d:0 "The Orleans monarchy, which marked the transition of power from the house of Bourbon to its younger branch, the House of Orleans, was a triumph of popular sovereignty over the principle of the divine right of the king, and also established a liberal order, a triumph for the bourgeoisie and the final defeat of the landed aristocracy. Despite all the opposition, the rule of the House of Orleans seems increasingly immutable even to the most radical opponents of the regime."

Let us firmly maintain, according to the Charter, the social order and all its conditions. Let us faithfully guarantee, according to the Charter, the public liberties and all their developments. We will hand over intact to the generations that will come after us the deposit that has been entrusted to us, and they will bless us for having founded and defended the edifice under the shelter of which they will live happy and free.» - Louis-Philippe d'Orléans"
