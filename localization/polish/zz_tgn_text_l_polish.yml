 tgn_je_events.1.d:0 "Insurgents in Upper and Lower Canada led rebellions against the Crown and the political status quo. Their political demands, which included democratic pleas for responsible government, were rejected in London. French Canadian farmers are suffering from an economic depression, and in the urban areas, tensions are rising between French Canadians and the anglophone minority. All of this has resulted to numerous rallies across the colony and calls for armed insurrection from the more radical Patriotes. The rebellions finally ended, after a few deadly confrontations with the crown's loyalist militias."
